Self-affine sets are attractors of IFSs consisting of affine contractions.  They are a well-studied and important class of fractal and are notoriously difficult to study since 
affine maps can distort by different amounts in different directions.  This is a particular case of the more general class of non-conformal attractors.  I have worked a lot with self-affine sets
and associated self-affine measures.  I am especially interested in planar carpet type sets, such as those introduced by Bedford and McMullen. I wrote a survey article on Bedford-McMullen carpets, which contains some open problems:
