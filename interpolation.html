One of the most beautiful and fundamental questions in fractal geometry is how to define the dimension of a fractal set or measure.  
There are many different ways to do this, each sensitive to a different geometric feature.  Dimension interpolation is a new idea which 
seeks to understand the relationship between two given notions of dimension by viewing them as different facets of the same object: 
a continuum of dimensions varying from one to the other.  There are three main ways to do this: the Assouad spectrum (introduced with Han Yu),
 intermediate dimensions (introduced with Kenneth Falconer and Tom Kempton) and the Fourier dimension spectrum (recently introduced).  I wrote a survey paper on the general idea for the 
proceedings of Fractal Geometry and Stochastics VI, which is probably a good place to start:

Plots of the Assouad spectrum (left) and intermediate dimensions (right) for an elliptical polynomial spiral.  The Assouad spectrum typically 
 has an increasing part and then a constant part, and the phase transition between these two regimes often has particular geometric significance.
  The smaller phase transition typically does not appear and was a surprise observation for this family of set.
