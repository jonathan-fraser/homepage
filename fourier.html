Fourier transforms play an important role in the dimension theory of fractals, as well as describing many other geometric properties. 
The Fourier dimension  of a measure captures the rate at which the Fourier transform decays at infinity and the Fourier dimension of a 
 set is the supreum of the Fourier dimension of measures it supports.  A non-trivial and highly useful fact to keep in mind is that the 
 Fourier dimension of a set never exceeds the Hausdorff dimension. Sets for which the Fourier transform and Hausdorff dimension coincide
 are known as Salem sets.  Salem sets abound in random settings, through pioneering work of Kahane and others, however, (non-trivial) 
deterministic Salem sets are much rarer.  An old question of Kahane asked if the graph of Brownian motion was almost surely a Salem set. 
 By establishing a Fourier analytic slicing theorem, we proved that the graph of any function on the reals never exceeds 1.  This answers
 Kahane's question in the negative, since the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of Brownian motion is almost surely 3/2. 
 Note that our solution is geometric, not stochastic:

The natural follow up (stochastic) qustion was to determine what the (almost sure) Fourier dimension of the graph of Brownian actually is. 
 We proved that is  1, the maximum value possible:
