Self-similar sets one are of the most fundamental classes of fractal.  They are made up of scaled down copies of themselves, see familiar examples below.
When the scaled down pieces are sufficiently separated, the cylinders provide efficient covers of the set and therefore dimension calculations become straightforward counting problems.
However, when there are overlaps the situation is much more complicated. During my PhD I observed that the Assouad dimension could be distinct from the Hausdorff dimension 
provided there are overlaps.  Later, in collaboration with Henderson, Olson and Robinson, I proved a dichotomy completely describing the Assouad dimension of 
self-similar sets in the line.  These papers are here:

Here are the  slides I used for a talk about the Assouad dimension of self-similar sets with overlaps:
