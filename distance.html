The distance set problem is a famous and well-studied problem in geometric measure theory.  It stems from a  paper of Kenneth Falconer from 1985 and asks about the
 relationship between a subset of Euclidean space and its <i>distance set</i>.  The distance set associated with a given set is simply the set of all distances
 realised between pairs of points in the set. For example, if the Hausdorff dimension of a Borel set in d-dimensional Euclidean space is at least d/2, then it 
is conjectured that the Hausdorff dimension of the distance set should be 1 (which is maximal, since the distance set is a set of real numbers).   I solved the Assouad dimension analogue of the distance
 set problem for subsets of the plane here:

<ul>
&#9658;   A nonlinear projection theorem for Assouad dimension and applications, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.12001">arXiv</a> <br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Journal of the London Mathematical Society</b>, 107, (2023), 777-797..</ul>


I have used Fourier analytic tools to study the distance set problem:

<ul>
&#9658; The Fourier   spectrum and sumset type problems, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07019">arXiv</a> <br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  <b>Mathematische Annalen</b>, 390, (2024), 3891-3930. </ul>

I also studied the finite fields distance problem:

 <ul>
&#9658;  <i>L</i><sup><i>p</i></sup> averages of the Fourier transform in finite fields, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08589">arXiv</a> <br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <i>submitted</i>.</ul>

I have   used ergodic  theoretic tools, such as CP-chains, to study the distance set problem.  For example, this approach was used to obtain partial 
results on the Assouad dimension problem here:


<ul>

&#9658;  Distance sets, orthogonal projections, and passing to weak tangents, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06900">arXiv</a> <br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Israel Journal of Mathematics</b>, 226, (2018), 851-875.</ul>


The ergodic theoretic approach is very useful when the underlying fractal is dynamically defined.  I used this approach to solve the Hausdorff dimension 
version of the distance problem for certain self-affine and self-conformal sets here:


     <ul>
&#9658;   Scaling scenery of (&times<i>m</i>,&times<i>n</i>) invariant measures (with A. Ferguson & T. Sahlsten), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.5023">arXiv</a> <br>
           &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Advances in Mathematics</b>, 268, (2015), 564-602.</ul>



<ul>
&#9658;  Micromeasure distributions and applications for conformally generated fractals (with M. Pollicott), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05609">arXiv</a> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society</b>, 159, (2015), 547-566.</ul>



I gave a talk about the ergodic theory approach to the distance set problem at a one day ergodic theory meeting in QMUL in 2015.  The slides are

I gave an Analysis Seminar about the general solution to the Assouad dimension problem in St Andrews in 2020.  Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7M5VZLQvzI">video</a>.
