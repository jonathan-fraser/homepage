The distance set problem is a notorious problem in geometric measure theory.  It stems from a  paper of Kenneth Falconer from 1985 and asks for the
 relationship between a subset of Euclidean and its <i>distance set</i>.  The distance set associated with a given set is simply the set of all distances
 realised between pairs of points in the set. For example, if the dimension of a Borel set in d-dimensional Euclidean space is at least d/2, then it 
is conjectured that the dimension of the distance set should be 1 (which is maximal, since the distance set is a set of real numbers). This question is
 usually posed for Hausdorff dimension, but equally well applies to packing, box, Assouad dimension etc.  I solved the Assouad dimension of the distance
 set problem for subsets of the plane here:

         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Journal of the London Mathematical Society</b> (to appear).</ul>


I have used Fourier analytic tools to study the distance set problem:

         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <i>submitted</i>.</ul>

I have also used ergodic  theoretic tools, such as CP-chains, to study the distance set problem.  For example, this approach was used to obtain partial 
results on the Assouad dimension problem here:


<ul>

&#9658;  Distance sets, orthogonal projections, and passing to weak tangents, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06900">arXiv</a> <br>
         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Israel Journal of Mathematics</b>, 226, (2018), 851-875.</ul>


The ergodic theoretic approach is very useful when the underlying fractal is dynamically defined.  I used this approach to solve the Hausdorff dimension 
version of the distance problem for certain self-affine and self-conformal sets here:

<ul>
&#9658;  Micromeasure distributions and applications for conformally generated fractals (with M. Pollicott), <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05609">arXiv</a> <br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society</b>, 159, (2015), 547-566.</ul>



I gave a talk about the ergodic theory approach to the distance set problem at a one day ergodic theory meeting in QMUL in 2015.  The slides are

I gave an Analysis Seminar about the general solution to the Assouad dimension problem in St Andrews in 2020.  Here is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7M5VZLQvzI">video</a>.
