There was a One Day Ergodic Theory meeting at the University of St Andrews on Thursday 14th June 2018. This is part of a network of collaborative meetings involving Bristol, Exeter, Leicester, Loughborough, Manchester, Queen Mary, St Andrews, Surrey and Warwick, funded by a Scheme 3 grant from the LMS.  This followed  the <a href="http://www.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~bmc2018/index.html">2018 BMC</a> which was held in St Andrews from 11th-14th June.  The talks were held in Lecture Theatre C in the Mathematical Institute and the schedule was as follows:

<br>
<br>

<ul>
<font size="4">1.30pm - 2.30pm: Rhiannon Dougall (University of Nantes). <i>Critical exponents for normal subgroups via a twisted Bowen-Margulis current.</i></font>
<br>
<blockquote>Abstract: For a discrete group &#915; of isometries of a negatively curved space 
<i>X</i>, the critical exponent &#948;(&#915;) measures the exponential 
growth rate of the orbit of a point. It is known for a certain class of 
&#915;<sub>0</sub> and <i>X</i>, that for any normal subgroup &#915; of &#915;<sub>0</sub>
we have &#948;(&#915;)=&#948;(&#915;<sub>0</sub>) if and only if the quotient 
&#915;<sub>0</sub>/&#915; is amenable. We will motivate this problem, and 
discuss what is new: the construction of a twisted Bowen-Margulis 
current on the double-boundary, which highlights a feature of 
ergodicity, and extends the class for which the result is known. This is 
joint work with R. Coulon, B. Schapira and S. Tapie.</blockquote>

<ul>
<font size="4">2.30pm - 3.30pm: Thomas Jordan (University of Bristol). <i>Multifractal analysis for Lyapunov exponents of self-affine iterated function systems.</i></font>
<br>
<blockquote>Abstract: Joint work with Balazs Barany, Antti Kaenmaki and Michal Rams. For a large class of self-affine systems in &#8477<sup><i>2</i></sup>   (strongly irreducible with a reasonable separation condition) we consider level sets where the local upper and lower Lyapunov exponents take prescribed values <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. We will find the Hausdorff dimension of these sets using a pressure function and a conditional variational principle and show the dimension varies continuously with <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. The main technique used is to approximate a suitable pressure function on these systems via dominated systems where Lyapunov exponents correspond to Birkhoff averages of Holder continuous functions. We also need to use a recent result on the dimension of Bernoulli measures on such systems due to Barany, Hochman and Rapaport.</blockquote>

<ul>
<font size="4">4.00pm - 5.00pm: Mark Demers (Fairfield University). <i>A measure of maximal entropy for the finite horizon periodic Lorentz gas.</i></font>
<br>
<blockquote> Abstract:  While the existence and properties of the SRB measure for the billiard map associated with a periodic Lorentz gas are well understood, there are few results regarding other types of measures for dispersing billiards.  We begin by proposing a naive definition of topological entropy for the billiard map, and show that it is equivalent to several classical definitions.  We then prove a variational principle for the topological entropy and proceed to construct a measure which achieves the maximum.  This measure is K-mixing and positive on open sets. An essential ingredient is a proof of the absolute continuity of the unstable foliation with respect to the measure of maximal entropy.  This is joint work with Viviane Baladi.</blockquote>
