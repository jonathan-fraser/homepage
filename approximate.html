Arithmetic progressions are fundamental objects in mathematics.  For example, 3, 7, 11, 15, 19 is an arithmetic progression of length 5 with gap size 4. 
Often one is interested in finding arithmetic progressions inside a given set, or proving that certain arithmetic progressions are not present.
Recall, the celebrated Green-Tao theorem which states that the prime numbers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions: structure within chaos! 
 A famous conjecture of Erd&#x0151s asserts that a set of positive integers whose reciprocals form a divergent series 
should contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.  (The Green-tao theorem is a special case of this conjecture.) 
It turns out that the following weak asymptotic version of this conjecture is much easier to prove and is related to dimension: 
a set of positive integers whose reciprocals form a divergent series 
gets arbitrarily close to arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions (in a natural sense).  I proved this result, together with Han Yu, here:

         &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society</b>, 50, (2018), 85-95.</ul>



I also wrote a survey article:

<ul>

&#9658; Almost arithmetic progressions in the primes and other large sets, <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01409">arXiv</a> <br>

&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>The American Mathematical Monthly</b>, 126, (2019), 553-558.</ul>



These results follow from the observation that getting arbitrarily close to arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions is equivalent to 
having Assouad dimension equal to 1 (maximal for subsets of the line).  Therefore a natural question to ask is, how large can the dimension of a set be
if the set uniformly avoids arithmetic progressions.  Papers on this topic include:

I gave an undergraduate lecture on our weak solution to the Erd&#x0151s problem, called 'An analyst's take on the integers'.  The video is

Another related problem in arithmetic combinatorics (and fractal geometry) is to consider how the size of a sumset compares to the size of the sets being summed. 
 An example, problem being to determine conditions under which the Hausdorff dimension of the sumset X+X strictly exceeds the Hausdorff dimension of X.  One can
 also conisder mixed sumsets X+Y, iterated sumsets X+X+...+X = kX, or constructions where the operation of addition is replaced by something else, e.g. multiplication.
  I have various results in this area, for example:
